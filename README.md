> “I give 98 percent of my mental energy to BChess; others give only 2 percent.”
> -- Bobby Fischer

BChess is a beginner-friendly chess in a console, with batteries included. 

# How to install

You can install (or upgrade to) the latest release version of
BChess from [PyPI] by running:

    python3 -m pip install --user bchess

[PyPI]: https://pypi.org/project/bchess/

This will install `bchess` program into `~/.local/bin` folder,
so you should be able to run it by just typing `bchess`. If
`~/.local/bin` is not in your `$PATH`, then you can still run
BChess via `python3 -m bchess`.

# How to play

> “To play for a draw, at any rate with white, is to some degree a crime against BChess.”
> -- Mikhail Tal

Start BChess, select your opponent, click on the piece you want
to move or enter your move in algebraic notation. Try to win.
Or at least have fun.
